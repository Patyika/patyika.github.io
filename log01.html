  <h1>ChatGPT Log #1</h1>
  <p>This is my first log shared.</p>
  <pre>

1.	You said:
I recently used faststone photo resizer for mass image resampling. It made 5 errors of approx 120. Never was errors in the past, and I used this program without any problems. After the errors I tried again (only about 30 peaces, beginning again with the firs errored image. It made 2-3 errors. I repeated this method, and eventually it made all the resampling well. This suggest me maybe my processor (intel core i7 920) sometimes making errors. Do you think the same? How to check it? Can you offer some processor test program for this?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, your suspicion is reasonable ‚Äî random, intermittent errors like the ones you describe can point to a potential hardware issue, especially when a task that‚Äôs normally reliable starts failing without software changes.
Given your CPU (Intel Core i7 920 ‚Äî a 2008-era chip), hardware aging or instability (e.g. from thermal stress or aging capacitors) is a possibility.
________________________________________
2.	üîé Could Your CPU Be at Fault?
Possibly. However, also consider other sources of error:
‚Ä¢	RAM instability (very common with intermittent errors)
‚Ä¢	Disk read/write errors
‚Ä¢	Thermal throttling (leading to unstable CPU behavior)
‚Ä¢	Power supply issues (especially in aging systems)
So don‚Äôt focus only on the CPU ‚Äî test all components involved.
________________________________________
3.	‚úÖ What to Do: Step-by-Step Diagnostics
4.	1. Check CPU Stability
Use stress testing and error-checking tools:
5.	üõ† Recommended CPU Test Programs:
1.	Prime95 (Blend Test)
‚Ä¢	Stresses CPU and RAM.
‚Ä¢	Let it run for several hours. If errors occur, it could indicate CPU or RAM issues.
2.	Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool (IPDT)
‚Ä¢	Official tool from Intel.
‚Ä¢	Verifies CPU functionality (cache, instructions, etc.).
3.	OCCT (OverClock Checking Tool)
‚Ä¢	All-in-one tool: stress tests CPU, RAM, GPU, and power supply.
‚Ä¢	Includes temperature monitoring and error detection.
________________________________________
6.	2. Check RAM Stability
RAM issues often mimic CPU errors.
7.	üõ† Use MemTest86:
‚Ä¢	Download from https://www.memtest86.com/
‚Ä¢	Boot from USB and let it run at least 4 passes (overnight preferred).
‚Ä¢	Any red errors = failing RAM.
________________________________________
8.	3. Check System Temperatures
Overheating can cause errors.
9.	Tools:
‚Ä¢	HWMonitor (https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html)
‚Ä¢	CoreTemp (https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/)
Monitor:
‚Ä¢	CPU temps under load (should stay under ~80‚Äì85¬∞C for an i7 920)
‚Ä¢	Check if thermal throttling occurs.
________________________________________
10.	4. Check Storage Health
If FastStone is reading/writing from a failing drive, it could be corrupted images.
11.	Tools:
‚Ä¢	CrystalDiskInfo (for SMART data)
‚Ä¢	chkdsk /f (Windows built-in disk check)
________________________________________
12.	üß™ Optional: Repeat the Image Resampling Test
After testing the hardware, try running the same resampling batch again and watch:
‚Ä¢	CPU temps
‚Ä¢	RAM usage
‚Ä¢	Disk activity
‚Ä¢	Any crash logs or FastStone logs (if available)
If errors happen at the same point, it might be corrupt source files.
If errors are random, likely hardware (RAM or CPU).
________________________________________
13.	üí° Final Thoughts
Given the age of your i7 920, hardware degradation is a real risk. However, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions ‚Äî run diagnostics first, especially MemTest86 and Prime95 Blend.
Let me know which tools you run and what results you get, and I can help interpret them.

prime95 asking for number of cores to torture test (offering 4). Should I use hyperthreading?
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî and yes, you should generally enable hyperthreading when stress testing with Prime95, especially if you're trying to uncover potential instability.
Let‚Äôs go over the details so you‚Äôre making the right call:
________________________________________
14.	‚úÖ Should You Use Hyperthreading in Prime95?
Yes. On your CPU (Intel Core i7 920), hyperthreading (HT) gives you 4 physical cores and 4 logical (virtual) threads ‚Äî total of 8 threads.
So:
‚Ä¢	If you want maximum stress on the CPU, use all 8 threads.
‚Ä¢	This stresses both physical and logical cores ‚Äî good for catching marginal CPU issues.
‚Ä¢	It may also uncover thermal or power issues more effectively.
________________________________________
15.	üîß How to Set Up Prime95 Properly
When Prime95 asks:
‚ÄúHow many torture threads to run?‚Äù
Enter: 8
(or just accept the default if it's showing 8)
Then choose one of the following modes:
‚Ä¢	Blend test ‚Äì Stresses both CPU and RAM. Recommended first.
‚Ä¢	Small FFTs ‚Äì Maximum heat and CPU stress (good for pure CPU testing).
‚Ä¢	Large FFTs ‚Äì CPU + some memory controller testing.
Start with Blend, then try Small FFTs if you want to really push the CPU.
________________________________________
16.	‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor While Testing
Run for at least 30 minutes to several hours. Watch for:
‚Ä¢	Errors (Prime95 will report them clearly)
‚Ä¢	Temperatures (use HWMonitor or CoreTemp ‚Äî keep < 85¬∞C)
‚Ä¢	System stability (freezes, reboots = fail)
________________________________________
17.	üí° Pro Tip
If you see errors only when hyperthreading is on, it might mean:
‚Ä¢	CPU is borderline stable (HT puts more stress on execution units and cache)
‚Ä¢	Power delivery or cooling can't handle full-thread load
If disabling HT makes errors go away, that‚Äôs a diagnostic clue ‚Äî but not a fix.
________________________________________
Let me know how the test goes or if you need help reading the results.
The program accepted only 1 to 4 on threads. I began the test and very soon (under 1 min) worker 1,3,4 fatal error, and I think on worker 2 is still running (?). Ah now is stopped. On worker 2 test is completed, 4 test in 5 minutes. 
ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the update ‚Äî and your results are very revealing.
________________________________________
18.	üî• Summary of What Happened:
‚Ä¢	Prime95 ran with 4 threads only (likely because your i7 920 has 4 physical cores, and you're using an older version or running in a way that ignores hyperthreading).
‚Ä¢	Within 1 minute, 3 out of 4 workers failed with fatal errors.
‚Ä¢	Only Worker 2 completed 4 tests in ~5 minutes ‚Äî but this still suggests system instability.
________________________________________
19.	üí° Interpretation: Likely Hardware Instability
This is not normal, even under full load.
Fatal errors in Prime95 indicate calculation failures, which almost always mean a hardware problem ‚Äî either:
20.	üö® Most Likely Causes:
1.	Unstable CPU
o	Overheating?
o	Aging silicon?
o	Overclocked? (Even unintentionally by BIOS)
2.	Faulty or borderline RAM
o	RAM can cause Prime95 errors even in CPU-only tests (Blend test uses RAM).
3.	Power delivery instability
o	Weak or aging power supply unit (PSU)
o	Motherboard VRMs not delivering stable voltage
4.	Thermal problems
o	Bad CPU cooler contact or dried-out thermal paste
o	Case airflow not sufficient
________________________________________
21.	‚úÖ What to Do Next
22.	1. Run MemTest86 (ASAP)
‚Ä¢	Bootable memory test (free at memtest86.com)
‚Ä¢	Run at least 4 passes
‚Ä¢	If any errors appear: RAM is your culprit (or possibly motherboard)
________________________________________
23.	2. Check CPU Temps
‚Ä¢	Download HWMonitor or CoreTemp
‚Ä¢	Watch temps while Prime95 is running
o	If it jumps to 80‚Äì100¬∞C quickly, you have a cooling issue.
o	Sudden thermal spikes can cause instability.
________________________________________
24.	3. Check BIOS Settings
‚Ä¢	Make sure nothing is overclocked
‚Ä¢	Set CPU to default settings (stock frequency and voltage)
‚Ä¢	Load "Optimized Defaults" or "Failsafe Defaults"
________________________________________
25.	4. Try Prime95 Small FFTs Test
‚Ä¢	This focuses on CPU only, with little RAM use.
‚Ä¢	If this still crashes, it's more likely the CPU or power.
________________________________________
26.	5. Check PSU and Motherboard (if others pass)
‚Ä¢	This is harder without tools, but if MemTest and temps are fine, suspect:
o	PSU (especially if it's older than 5 years)
o	Motherboard (VRM degradation or capacitor aging)
________________________________________
27.	üí¨ Final Notes
Your test strongly suggests a hardware fault ‚Äî and given the i7 920‚Äôs age (15+ years), it's not surprising. You‚Äôre probably seeing early signs of failure.
If you want to keep using the system:
‚Ä¢	Run more diagnostics (start with MemTest86)
‚Ä¢	Try cleaning/reseating components
‚Ä¢	Consider underclocking slightly to improve stability
But realistically, it may be time to think about upgrading the platform soon ‚Äî even low-end modern CPUs will vastly outperform your i7 920, and with better stability and power efficiency.
Let me know if you want help interpreting MemTest results or picking a replacement system.
